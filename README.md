# Task-5-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Includes data cleaning, statistical summaries, visualizations, and insights to understand factors affecting passenger survival. Deliverables include a Jupyter Notebook and a PDF report.

# Dataset
train.csv: Training data containing passenger features and survival outcome.
test.csv: Test data for which survival predictions are to be made.

# Tools Used
Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

# Key Tasks Completed
Loaded and cleaned the dataset (handled missing values)
Performed statistical exploration with .describe(), .info(), .value_counts()

# Created visualizations:
Histograms and KDE plots for distributions
Countplots for categorical features vs survival
Boxplots to analyze fare and age impact
Scatterplots to observe relationships between age, fare, and survival
Correlation heatmap to find numeric feature correlations
Pairplot for multivariate relationships
Summarized insights and trends observed from the data

# Summary of Findings
Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males.
Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival than those in lower classes.
Younger passengers and those who paid higher fares tended to survive more.
Missing data was primarily in Age and Embarked columns and was handled appropriately.
Overall, socio-economic factors (class, fare) and demographics (age, gender) played a strong role in survival.
